## What is ShatteredPVP?
The original ShatteredPVP started off as a CommandBlock based Minigame made by my friend Penguino
Sadly the CommandBlock version broke in the most recent versions of Minecraft, So I contacted Penguino and asked if I can made a plugin version of the game

## Main Mechanic:
As an arrow hits glass/stained glass, it breaks down till regular glass then it breaks
